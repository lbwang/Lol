This branch (prototuples) is a work-in-progress to add the capability to issue RLWE/RLWR challenges over product rings. We have resolved the issue of serializing
product rings, and I think all of the other changes have been made. All this
really needs, if we decide to add support for challenges over product rings,
is to merge master.
